1)
Banana is a method that takes an array and multiplies every element of the array with each other (product of all the elements in the array). 
  "kiwi" is what is used to reduce the process into a single value. i is the index.


2)
The method grapefruit takes an array and an integer, and finds the first appearance of that integer value in the array (i.e, finds the index of the integer). 
  "grape" is the integer being searched for, and again i is the index.


3)
The method pineapple searches through the array and makes a count of how many times a certain integer appears in the list.
"apple" is the integer that is being searched for.
"pine" stands for each value in the array being "looked at" at any given moment. (like the example from 8.10, it's like "for each value in values").
"pear" is the counter for the number of times the integer is found in the list.
