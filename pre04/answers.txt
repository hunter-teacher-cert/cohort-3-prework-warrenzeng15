      main[     ]
      zoop [ "just for",   5  ]
      ping [  "any not more" ] 
      clink [  10  ]
      zoop [ "breakfast", 10]


    2)output:
    just for
    any not more
    It's breakfast
    !

 Zoop is the first method to be invoked, using the string "just for" and the integer 5. since the variable "bob" is == 5, we go to ping("not"), which subsequently printlns "any"+ "not" + "more". Next under main is clink(2*5), so clink(10). This print's out "It's", and then we go back to zoop as zoop("breakfast",10). However unlike last time, the condition is not filled and we go to the else statement -- which simply prints "!" on the new line.
