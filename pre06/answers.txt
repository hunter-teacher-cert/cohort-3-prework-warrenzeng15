We start with n being 10, so therefore i = 10. This gets printed. Since 10 is divisible by 2, we divide by 2 and get 5, which gets printed on the next line. We go onto the next iteration. Since 5 is not divisible by 2, we add 1, so i becomes 6. Next iteration. 6 is divisible by 2, so we divide by 2 and get i = 3. Next we add 1 (3 is not divisible by 2) = 4. Finally, 4 is divisible by 2 and "2" is printed. 2 is then divided by 1, where we finally get i = 1. Since the while condition is i > 1, the loop terminates -- it terminates right before 1 would be printed out.




3)
  For all positive numbers n, they must be either even or odd. In the loop method, even numbers are divided by 2 and odd numbers are increased by 1 (so that they can be divisible by 2). There does not exist a case in which this is not true; regardless of how large the positive integer will be, the loop will eventually terminate. As such, we can conclude that this loop will terminate for any positive value of n.
